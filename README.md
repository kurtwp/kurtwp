# Kurt W. Pasewaldt 👋
## 🛠️ Professional Portfolio & Homelab Journey 

Welcome to my Github for **building, breaking, and learning**!

---------------
My Github repository serves as my professional showcase, centered around my ongoing Homelab Projects.

> By maintaining my Github repository as a **living sandbox** it allows me to utilize my homelab as a test bench for maintaining and developing skills from **documentation** to **device setups** through **advanced configuration** and **automation scripting**.  

 ### Key Areas of Expertise Demonstrated:
I use my homelab to document and practice core skills, including:

- **Platform Engineering**: Bare-metal virtualization and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker).

- **Networking & Security**: Network configuration, segmentation (VLANs), and firewall management.

- **Cloud & Hybrid Integration**: Configuring seamless connections and services with public cloud providers.

- **System Automation**: Creating reliable solutions for provisioning, configuration, and maintenance.
  
> The creation of the configuration files, scripts, and documentation pages here demonstrates my ability to build, manage, and secure IT environments.

----------------
###  What You'll Find Here:
* **System Administration**: (Linux/Windows)
* **Networking**: Setup and configurations of networking devices.
* **Network Diagrams:** Documentation on VLANs, firewall rules, VPN setup, etc...
* **Project Deep-Dives:** Case studies on deploying services such as **Troubleshooting, Wireshark/Tshark, Proxmox, Hyper-V, Self-hosting, and Protocols, e.g., SIP/RTP,** to name a few.
* **Certification Journey:** What I used to help me pass the JNCIA and CCNA exams.

This documentation directly demonstrates my expertise in **Networking**<small>(VoIP & Data)</small>, **Troubleshooting**, **Virtualization**, and **Documentation**. Feel free to explore my setup and the code behind it!
