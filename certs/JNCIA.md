# JNCIA-Junos Exam Prep: My Resource Guide
Here's a breakdown of the resources I used and found helpful when preparing for and passing the **JNCIA-Junos (JN0-105)** exam.

## Juniper Official Online Course
I used the [Juniper Official Online Course](https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=12035). To be honest, I didn't find the content of this self-paced course very useful for actual learning. However, completing the course is mandatory to qualify for the official exam discount. My strategy was to fast forward through the videos to register completion status for each module. The effort paid off: after finishing the course, I took and passed the official practice exam on my first attempt (you get three tries). Passing this practice exam earned me a voucher for 75% off the full exam cost. Just remember, this 75% off voucher is only valid for online proctored exams and you have 30 days to use the voucher.

## Udemy Courses (Highly Recommended)
I found two specific Udemy resources to be very effective for my preparation, and I strongly recommend buying them when they go on sale. The first was the Udemy - **Juniper JNCIA-Junos - NEW JN0-105 Complete Course** by Ben Jacobson, which provided a great comprehensive look at the material. The second, and arguably more valuable, was the Udemy - **JNCIA-Junos JN0-105 Practice Exams** by S2 Academy, which was excellent for testing my knowledge and readiness.
