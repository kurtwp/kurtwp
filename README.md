## 🛠️ Homelab Journey & Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my Github for **building, breaking, and learning**!

---------------
This repository serves as my professional showcase, centered around my ongoing Homelab Projects.

> This environment is a living sandbox for developing the required infrastructure skills. My homelab functions as my test bench for learning the full IT lifecycle, from foundational setup to advanced configuration and automation. 

 ### Key Areas of Expertise Demonstrated:
I use this homelab to document and practice core skills, including:

- **Platform Engineering**: Bare-metal virtualization and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker).

- **Networking & Security**: Network configuration, segmentation (VLANs), and firewall management.

- **Cloud & Hybrid Integration**: Configuring seamless connections and services with public cloud providers.

- **System Automation**: Creating reliable solutions for provisioning, configuration, and maintenance.
  
> Every configuration file, script, and documentation page here offers evidence of my ability to build, manage, and secure a resilient IT environment.

----------------
###  What You'll Find Here:
* **System Administration**: (Linux/Windows)
* **Networing**: Setup and configurations of networking devices.
* **Network Diagrams:** Documentation on VLANs, firewall rules,VPN setup, etc...
* **Project Deep-Dives:** Case studies on deploying services such as **Toubleshooting, Wireshark/Tshark, Proxmox, Hyper-V, Self-hosting, and Protocols e.g. sip/rtp,** to name a few.
* **Certifaction Journey:** What I used to help me pass the JNCIA and CCNA exams.

This documentation directly demonstrates my expertise in **Networking**<small>(VoIP & Data)</small>, **Troubleshooting**, **Virtualization**, and **Documentation**. Feel free to explore my setup and the code behind it!
