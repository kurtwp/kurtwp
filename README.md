## 🛠️ Homelab Journey & Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my space for **building, breaking, and learning**!

This repository serves as my professional showcase, centered around my **Homelab Projects**. From bare-metal virtualization and container orchestration (like **Kubernetes** and **Docker**) to network comnfiguration, network segmentation, cloud integrations and **system automation**. This journey serves as a living, breathing sandbox for **real-world infrastructure development**.

This environment acts as my test bench for mastering **cloud-native technologies** and **system automation**. Every configuration file, script, and documentation page here is a concrete example of my ability to manage the full lifecycle of an IT environment.

This repository serves as my professional showcase, centered around my ongoing Homelab Project.

This environment is a living, real-world sandbox for developing modern infrastructure skills. It functions as my test bench for mastering the full IT lifecycle, from foundational setup to advanced automation.

🔑 Key Areas of Expertise Demonstrated:
I use this homelab to document and practice core skills, including:

Platform Engineering: Bare-metal virtualization and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker).

Networking & Security: Network configuration, segmentation (VLANs), and firewall management.

Cloud & Hybrid Integration: Configuring seamless connections and services with public cloud providers.

System Automation: Creating reliable solutions for provisioning, configuration, and maintenance.

Every configuration file, script, and documentation page here offers concrete evidence of my ability to build, manage, and secure a resilient IT environment.

### 🌟 What You'll Find Here:
* **System Administration** (Linux/Windows)
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** [Mention tool, e.g., Terraform] configurations for provisioning services.
* **Network Diagrams:** Documentation on **VLANs**, firewall rules, and VPN setup.
* **Project Deep-Dives:** Case studies on deploying services like **[Mention 2-3 specific services, e.g., ELK stack, self-hosted CI/CD, and centralized monitoring]**.
* **Certifaction Journey:** What I used to help me pass the JNCIA and CCNA exams. 

This documentation directly demonstrates my expertise in **[Key skill 1]**, **[Key skill 2]**, and **[Key skill 3]**. Feel free to explore my setup and the code behind it!
